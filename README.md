## 🌟 Project Overview

EchoVision empowers visually impaired users to interact with and interpret their surroundings in a more intuitive and accessible way. The application analyzes uploaded images, provides object detection details, and narrates the scene through a conversational AI chatbot.

Key features include:
- **Image Upload and Analysis:** Users can upload images for analysis, where the app detects objects and generates a detailed caption.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Once the scene is analyzed, the application converts the description into speech for users to hear.
- **Object Detection:** The app detects various objects in the image and highlights them with bounding boxes and labels.
